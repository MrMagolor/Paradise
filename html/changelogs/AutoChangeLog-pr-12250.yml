  - tweak: "Atmos pushing completely refactored; it'll still push you frequently and push items around frequently, but it won't throw you. Depending on how many dense objects or turfs are around you to \"grab onto\" will determine how effective atmos is at pushing you around. Does not alter the speed at which LINDA runs."
